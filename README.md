# vimrc_and_vim_directory
Holds my .vimrc file and .vim/ directory

These files contain a vim configuration that has worked nicely for me.  Feel free to inspect the `.vimrc` file for the different plugins and such that I've implemented (almost no credit for any of this stuff goes to me, as I found most of the stuff I used online).

I recommend also checking out the fantastic collection of plugins on www.vimawesome.com
